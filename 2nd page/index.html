          <h2>What is Sequestration</h2>
          <h3>Sequestration is the Scottish term for Bankruptcy. It, like Trust Deeds, has its place in the debt solution market depending on your specific circumstance.</h3>
          <p>Many people we speak to tend to shy away from Bankruptcy, but it should not be discounted. Often is the case that people are just mis-informed about what Bankruptcy actually is and how it works. We are happy to explain the process in detail if you contact us. Alternatively, we have added a useful FAQ which might answer some of your questions. We have also set out some information below which you shall hopefully find useful.</p>
          <p>The period of Sequestration is currently 4 years, as with Trust Deeds. There are certain restrictions which apply to you when you enter Bankruptcy and those restrictions generally include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You cannot be a Director of a Limited Company;</li>
            <li>You cannot obtain credit while Bankrupt;</li>
            <li>You cannot sit, in most cases, in certain public office positions – such as a MSP or run for First Minister;</li>
            <li>Bankruptcy will affect your credit rating, however, you will be able to repair this in good time.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Bankruptcy is a formal means in which to attend to debts you are not able to pay. In order to declare yourself Bankrupt</p>

            <p>An application must be made and submitted to the Accountant in Bankruptcy. The Accountant in Bankruptcy is a Public Office and supervises the administration of all Bankruptcies and Trust Deeds in Scotland.</p>

        <article class="container">
          <h3>In order to make an application for Bankruptcy, you must fulfill certain criteria. Such as:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>You must owe a total debt of at least £1,500, but no more than £17,000 for MAP. MAP is a Minimum Assets Process and will apply to you if your debts are under £17,000.00, a Money Adviser has deemed that you are not in a position to pay anything to your debts and you do not own any assets, such as a house.</li>
            <li>If your debts are over £17,000, or you own assets valuing £2,000 or more, then you can only apply for bankruptcy under the full administration route. We can explain what this means in greater detail.</li>
            <li>You must have received money advice from a money adviser.</li>
            <li>You must be living in Scotland, have lived in Scotland or have established a place of business in Scotland, in the year immediately preceding the date of your application.</li>
            <li>You must not have been made bankrupt in the last 5 years.</li>
            <li>You must pay the application fee.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>When you make the application for Bankruptcy, which we can assist you with, you are able to either appoint a Private Trustee, such as an Insolvency Practitioner working at J3 Debt Solutions, or you can allow the Accountant in Bankruptcy to act as your Trustee.</p>
